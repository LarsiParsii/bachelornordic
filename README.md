FILES
- main_unit			Contain the code for the main unit. Comprises CoAP, GNSS, LTE, and sensor functionality. Build for nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns.
- vessel_unit		Contain code for the vessel unit. It has CoAP, GNSS, and LTE functionality, but is not able to read the Main Unit's CoAP resource. Build for nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns.
- main_unit_ble		Contains code meant for the main unit. It acts as a working Bluetooth LE peripheral, broadcasting its GSS service along with Device Information Service (DIS). Test with the nRF Connect app. Build for nrf52840dk_nrf52840.
- vessel_unit_ble	Contain code meant for the vessel unit. It acts as a Bleutooth LE central, automatically connecting to main units over BLE which have a specific model number in their Device Information Service (DIS). Build for nrf52840dk_nrf52840.
